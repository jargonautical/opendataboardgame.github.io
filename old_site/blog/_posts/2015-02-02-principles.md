title: Principles behind an open data board game
---

At our first internal board game workshop, we crowd sourced principles to guide the board game design process - what people like and what they want to avoid. These were the results:

##What we want

* It should challenge how we think about sharing data and open data.
* It should be collaborative.
* It should be fun, but with a lot at stake immediately.
* It should explain what open data is.
* It should be aimed at ages 9+. Simple enough for new players, but not so simple. Family friendly - perhaps with an 'easy' version and harder extension.
* It should be lush. It should be engaging
* It should be tactile. There should be physical things to pass around.
* There should be an element of chance/luck/randomness.
* It should be a reflection of the open data community - fun, open, random.
* It should be extendable. We should be able to add extra cards, pieces, levels of complexity.
* There should be stacking pieces.
* It should take into account things like colour blindness. But it should be colourful!
* It should involve building a data commons - constructing a data board.

*It would be nice to have*

* Collaborative but with the ability to win individually!
* Support for a two player version
* Being finished in 45 minutes (once you know how to play)

##What we want to avoid

* Gimmicks.
* Being shallow.
* QR codes. Obviously.
* An easily lost important game piece.
* Long complex instructions.
* Being too complex to remember/play.
* Being laborious.
* Being “UK/English centric” - culturally and linguistically.
* Being breakable.
* Being boring.
* Having a long period where it’s obvious who’s won, or lost, or whole game won/lost.
* Game set up that’s longer than 5 minutes.
* Being too focused on data and not on impact.
* Being too ‘geeky’ - needs to appeal to the masses.
* Players being kicked out of gameplay.
* Maths.
* Having a long time where a player isn’t doing anything/ doesn’t need to pay attention.

*We'll try to avoid*

* Dice games (maybe)
* Having too many bits and pieces in the box

##If people could only take away one message about open data, it would be:

* It’s about impact - social, environmental, economic.
* Open data helps us as a society to address the big challenges.
* Open data is more valuable the more of it there is.
* Open data is a thing. The thing is good.
* Public benefits all. Private benefits only some.
* This stuff is not difficult.
* Data is not just for geeks.
